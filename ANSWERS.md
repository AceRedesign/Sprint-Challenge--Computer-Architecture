1.  Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

I believe concurrency is when a processor is switching between multiple tasks while advancing each bit before switching to advance another.

2.  Describe assembly language and machine language:

Assembly language cannot be executed by the computer. In order for the computer to understand what's being inputted it has to be compiled into machine language which is compromised of only 0's and 1's.

3.  Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?

A graphics card can provide the cpu with accelerated performance making processing tasks faster, the bottleneck is not the cpu anymore.

4.  Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:

You can do more operations at any given time with graphics cards because GPUs have multiple numbers of cores, sure it may be slower than the cpu, but it can hold a lot more tasks albeit being slower.
